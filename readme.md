# Misc. Python Projects

---

## Goal

The purpose of this repository is to document my data structures and algorithms
review work and protype tools that I've built to assist in learning.

## Project Structure

---

### Leetcode

The "leetcode" directory contains my solutions, which are run through a prototype
test driver that I built in order to test the code locally.

- Problems are organized into subdirectories by difficulty.
- Each subdirectory contains a README.md that discusses the approaches used
in solving the problem.
    - This readme is autogenerated by readme_generator.py in the "tools" directory.
- The "utils" directory is meant to contain scripts that help me run and test
code locally.

### Tools

The "tools" directory is meant to contain prototype tools that I've built alongside
my learning experience.
