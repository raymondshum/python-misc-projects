# 1293_shortest_path_in_a_grid_with_obstacles_elimination.py

**File Name**: 1293_shortest_path_in_a_grid_with_obstacles_elimination.py

**Key Point**:  Use BFS. Track "state" in the "seen" set along with steps. Allow for the case that there is no solution. 

**Link**: [shortest path in a grid with obstacles elimination](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-path-in-a-grid-with-obstacles-elimination/ )

**Method**: Use BFS. At each cell, explore the 4 cardinal directions. If it's valid, add the next move to the queue. Track state in the "seen" set. (Meaning track the number of times you can destroy an obstacle). This is because different paths can approach different obstacles with a different history of usage for removal. Return num steps once the lower right hand cell is reached. 

**Returns**: Int representing num steps in the shortest path or -1 if none exist.
